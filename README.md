# 📝 Note Taking App

A simple note-taking app designed as a **starter project** to help you learn how to start a project from scratch and take it all the way to completion. This project serves as a **catalyst for understanding full-stack development** (i.e. hopefully it'll help you within your job)

---

## 🚀 Purpose

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is **YOUR** project, meaning **YOU** will be taking the lead while I'll be in the background for any additional help


This app is built to:

- Help you learn how to structure, build, and complete a full project from the ground up.
- Teach the fundamentals of planning, building, and hosting software in some format.
- Create a minimalist, functional note-taking app as a real-world use case.
- Practice using Git, code editors, and dev tools in a real environment.

## 🧱 Tech Stack (TBD)

> [!NOTE]
> The goal is **not** to build something fancy, but to get your feet in the water and have something you can use everyday. 


We'll finalize the stack as we go, but here a potential stack we can use:

- **Frontend**: React.js (or plain HTML/CSS/JS to start simple)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: None (for now), or simple local storage / file-based system / JSON file
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Render

---

## ✅ Features

> [!NOTE]
> The list below, are just some simple things I thought of feel free to add or delete this is YOUR project. 

This app will include:

- [ ] Create a note
- [ ] View all notes
- [ ] Edit a note
- [ ] Delete a note
- [ ] Save notes to local storage or a backend
- [ ] Simple, clean UI

---

## 🛠 How to Run (will update as we build)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The instructions for running will be updated once the tech stack is chosen and fully fleshed out.

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Astroid45/Note-Taking-App
   cd Note-Taking-App
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if we add them later):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🌱 Learning Goals

This project is about **learning by doing**. You’ll get practice with:

- Git + GitHub workflows
- Setting up a project folder and structure
- Writing and organizing code
- Building UI components
- Connecting frontend and backend (if added)
- Debugging and testing
- Deploying to the web (if applicable)
- **Writing documentation** **(VERY IMPORTANT)**

---

## 📌 Milestones

> [!NOTE]
> As you work through these milestones copy the ✅ into the brackets.


We'll work in small steps:

1. [ ] Set up project structure (folder, GitHub, basic HTML/React <--- Depends on what you choose could even by Flask)
2. [ ] Build UI to create/view notes
3. [ ] Add edit/delete functionality
4. [ ] Add storage (localStorage or backend)
5. [ ] Polish UI with basic styling
6. [ ] Deploy to web
7. [ ] Reflect on what you’ve built 🧠

## 💡 Motivation Points
> [!CAUTION]
> Although LLM's (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) are great resources **REMEMBER** the code is **NOT** 100% correct. Please understand the code you copy so you can counteract any errors that arise.  

- Don't worry about being perfect.
- Google/LLM's is your best friend.
- Ask lots and lots of questions when you're stuck or just look it up.
- Break the problem into small chunks.
- Just _keep building_.

---

## 🧠 Big Picture

The app itself is simple but **this should help with learning the workflow of starting from nothing to something**. By the end, you’ll understand what it’s like to go from an idea → to code → to something real that you can use.
